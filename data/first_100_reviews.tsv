0	173658866	P443401	2	Too similar and no lasting power	I bought this because I already love Arancia di Capri and wanted to try other scents by this brand, but I will be returning it. Most of the scents are very similar (Bergamotto, Fico and Mirto in particular). Chinotto to me smells like soap, it was my least favourite of the five. The bottles don't have sprays. Also, the perfumes don't last. I still love Arancia di Capri, but it's basically the only one.	False	2021-02-15T18:09:41.000+00:00	Combination	Blue	Blonde	Fair			P443401

2	167552732	P443401	4	Not long lasting enough, a bit too feminine	I had a few of these as samples and really liked them, but I’m convinced those samples may have been men’s, because they were more bracing. Note, these are not parfum, but eau de toilette, so they are nice, but for me have zero staying power. They’re a pleasantly scented collection, but all bit too soft and each too similar for my taste. If there’s a men’s set, I may try it. This is a great gift for someone who enjoys lighter scents.	True	2020-12-10T05:36:56.000+00:00	Combination	Brown	Brunette	Light			P443401

Just like the original, they all have that ever so  slight hint of a soapy base (that I usually dont like).....BUT, it's always light and clean, and subtle. I have enjoyed each one of these in this set. They work great alone or layered. The staying power is longer for some more than others.
I recommend these for the Spring/Summer time. The box and mini bottles, look beautiful, and I'd consider this as a great gift for someone."	True	2019-05-08T02:22:00.000+00:00	Combination	Brown	Brunette	Light	35-44		P443401

This is a true unisex fragrance,men like it and women can wear it also. Its an everyday year round scent, light but with enough ""body"" to wear in the fall.

1	157739237	P163604	5	All Time Classic	Not one of the unchallenging, sweet, hyper-clean metrosexual fragrances you're probably used to. Colonia is a very old school citrus aromatic scent with a very mature, gentlemanly feel. One of the all-time classics.	True	2020-06-07T03:27:44.000+00:00							P163604
2	143973102	P163604	4	Eternally Simple, Clean and Classic	This scent I found for only $40 at Winners, and without smelling it, I bought it. I opened it up to experience a scent that instantly reminded me of Lush for some reason. It's masculine at first but softens into a genderless, mildly citrusy, slightly floral musk that changes form as the day wears on. The staying power isn't great; a few hours on skin, longer on clothes and fabric. The price is a lot for something that doesn't wear that long, but to each their own. It reacts well with my chemistry; I lean sweet in general, and prefer clean smells like Chanel No.5 (all variations), No. 19 Poudre, Chance eau Tendre or eau Vive, and so on. I usually only wear Chanel, but this is my new summer scent. It's never gaudy or overpowering. Works on anyone.	True	2020-03-13T00:57:35.000+00:00	Combination	Brown	Auburn	Fair			P163604

I’d say it’s more of a men’s cologne but I can see it being unisex as well. In that case, it’s more of a statement. Very refreshing and uplifting! 
Signature cylindrical bottle, rounded box and bright yellow packaging looks very chic and classy. If that’s not the best present for a loved one I don’t know what is.

I don't get the ""old man"" or ""old woman"" reference that you read very occasionally in some reviews about this fragrance. If it's true then there are some fantastic smelling senior citizens out there!

Lasts 4-6 hours on my skin. Incredibly clean smelling after the citrus dries down a bit. I'll always have this fragrance in my collection."		2016-10-31T20:11:02.000+00:00							P163604

12	65893957	P163604	5	OMG	So I took this sample with me when I went on vacation,and I found a fragrance for life. It's so incredibly fresh that it truly does out you in a better mood. I can occupy myself for a considerable amount of time just trying to smell all the different notes that this fragrance offers. This is the one fragrance that I will not tell anyone what it is. Call me selfish but it is really that good.		2016-05-17T05:49:52.000+00:00							P163604

14	47910223	P163604	3	Top Notes Are Powerful	Definitely an overpowering smell right at first. It requires some time before the first notes die down. Only after that will I find the fresh scent to be quite lovely. The citrus notes are barely detectable at first, but will linger in a really gentle blend with the other notes. Not something I'll wear, but it is a scent I would enjoy sniffing as I walk into a bathroom or something. Didn't enjoy this product as much as I had hoped. Nonetheless, scent is great (after top notes fade).		2015-07-27T06:49:52.000+00:00					18-24		P163604
15	47751409	P163604	4	Great unisex scent for summer	"Class. Sophistication. Elegance.

Colonia is a beautiful trip of nostalgia. Although the citrus, floral and warm basenotes definitely compliment me as a woman, they bring to mind the crisp citrus and spice splash the barber used on my father and grandfather after a cut and shave on Saturday mornings. There is also a light soapiness that smells like clean skin after a shower.

My husband and I both enjoy this classic scent. The longevity is only a few hours, hence the four stars. However, this lovely scent is well worth the price and the extra application later in the day."		2015-07-20T14:32:11.000+00:00					45-54		P163604
16	47500954	P163604	5	My New Signature Scent	When I first apply it, I get a beautiful, sharp citrus. Within 30 minutes or so, it becomes a soft, powdery, clean scent. It IS old man-ish/old lady-ish, but in the best way possible, I think. I've only worn it today, and I can already tell it's my new favorite. Very cool and sophisticated. Simple, yet complicating. Something about it reminds me of the Greenbrier Resort or a southern country club. Love it!		2015-07-08T17:31:47.000+00:00					18-24		P163604

19	36391909	P163604	4	I like it a lot	"I want to love this. But I merely like it - a lot, though! It is iust a bit too sharp for me. I love citrus-based scents and this definitely falls into that category. Unfortunately, because Sephora does not carry this in my local (or any???) store, I had buy it ""scent unsniffed"" haha. (Sight unseen...) I do think the body lotion would be just lovely with a slightly ""warmer"" scent layered on top.

I will not return it. I do like it! If you can test it in, say, another store, do.... It may work better for you, as everyone reacts differently to perfume.

It does smell ""luxurious,"" if that makes sense. And I do feel luxuriant spraying it on.

Oh, one last thing. It does not last terribly long on me. But... I have yet to find a perfume that will last more than three hours on my skin."		2014-05-02T22:42:46.000+00:00					35-44		P163604
20	30348669	P163604	5	Fresh, sophisticated, elegant	I've been searching for years to find a woman's scent that smells elegant and clean. The search is over---Audrey Hepburn and I agree. Acqua di Parma is sun-drenched Italian Riviera with a deep green dry-down--and very hard to find. (Fortunately Sephora carries it.) Expensive? Yes. And it smells like it.

21	30207754	P163604	4	My husband loves it	I got a sample of it with my order thinking it was a women's scent. I ended up giving it to my husband and he wasn't sure about it at first but ended up falling in love with it. I love it on him. It smells a little like feminine citrus perfumes to me but its still nice .		2013-07-30T16:21:41.000+00:00							P163604
22	30155473	P163604	5	Love this...	I must admit, I bought this for myself thinking that it's often touted as unisex. Hmm...I like a variety of scents but I always felt like I was wearing a man's cologne with this. So I gave it to my 24 year old son. He loves it. He told me that people are always complementing him on this fragrance, more so than with any other fragrance. It actually does smell much better on him than it ever did on me, classic, very clean and masculine.		2013-07-24T18:19:00.000+00:00					over 54		P163604
23	28981241	P163604	2	A little too Old School for us	I got this for my husband and I to try since I heard it is a unisex fragrance. Uh, not really. It's pretty manly, and by manly I mean 80 year old European. We just thought it was soapy, medicinal-herbacous and not for us. Thankful for Sephora's generous return policy.		2013-05-07T19:15:40.000+00:00					45-54		P163604
24	26456023	P163604	1		This gave me a terrible headache. It is one of those scents you can't wash off. It reminds me of public restrooms--it is like a toilet-y scent masked with scented bathroom cleanser.		2013-01-07T17:14:28.000+00:00					35-44		P163604

26	26331565	P163604	1	Mossy, Earthy, Icky	I don't agree with the description that this is fresh, luminous, or elegantly timeless. It's extremely heavy on the patchouli/orange notes but to be honest, it simply smells like a generic soap that's overstayed its welcome. I would not recommend this to anyone.		2012-12-29T07:35:36.000+00:00					25-34		P163604
27	26298853	P163604	5	Perfume with memories attached	"This is a wonderful perfume that balances a classic, woodsy masculine scent with the crispness of citrus.

Interesting story: when I first sprayed it on my wrist, it drove me CRAZY trying to figure out what it reminded me of, because it is incredibly evocative of a scent from my childhood. I asked my boyfriend and he insisted that it was ""old Old Spice, before they reformulated."" But I knew that couldn't be it. Finally, I put my finger on it: it smells almost EXACTLY like that Tinkerbell cologne they sold for little girls (maybe they still do?) when I was a child. Stronger smelling, of course, but a dead ringer!"		2012-12-27T04:49:12.000+00:00					25-34		P163604
28	26291372	P163604	3	a classic but not a wow	This is a great everyday scent - it does not linger too long and smells light and clean. The dry down is almost non-existent, you will not be aware of it. I am glad I only got a small size. I coveted it for so long only to find that it really doesn't do much for me. I like the scent but it's not evocative enough.		2012-12-26T19:54:22.000+00:00					35-44		P163604

30	26054218	P163604	5		I got this for my boyfriend, whom I love dearly. He works as a lawyer, and is often involved in community and human rights issues. He goes for conferences a lot. He is young in his late 20s, but his drive and motivation and tenacity matches the scent of this perfume. I was deciding between terre d'hermes and this, and decided on this. It has a classic scent to it, its darker and richer and more manlier I suppose, and it comes off as an intimidating smell. Not to be worn by softy types. It takes a personality and a persona to wear this scent fittingly. It doesn't last extremely long though and there is a need for him to constantly reapply. I love the scent on him, reminds me of good old awesome roll of cigar.		2012-12-09T01:38:11.000+00:00					25-34		P163604

But I really love the subtle, clean scent of Acqua di Parma. Its now my go to and even scents i used to find subtle seem overpowering to me. I've never smelled this on a man, but I know as a woman, I've never received more compliments on my ""scent"" than since i started wearing this one. I hightly recommend it!"		2012-10-23T15:33:33.000+00:00					35-44		P163604
32	23855549	P163604	5	classic, timeless	This fragrance is a classic, clean fragrance that several generations of men have worn. My grandfather wore this. It is definitely a mens cologne. Even though it has a floral note and a soapy end note, I think it is a bit strong and masculine in the middle for most women to carry. It has been my favorite for about 20 years. Almost daily compliments on this fragrance, guys.		2012-06-01T05:41:08.000+00:00					45-54		P163604

I thought it was a women's cologne, but after reading all these reviews I'm realizing it may be for men? At any rate, I think the scent is clean and definitely unisex, although it is a bit masculine smelling. I will have my hubby try.

37	21514042	P163604	5	Clean Scent	I bought this cologne based on previous reviews. It is a very clean and mature scent. You definately pick up a lemony smell at first but it changes and the other notes develop. My boyfriend loves fresh scents and really liked this gift. It is not your typical scent and I would recommend it for someone who doesn't want to smell like every other man out there.		2012-01-12T05:36:54.000+00:00					25-34		P163604
38	19065919	P163604	5	A Favorite!	I purchased this for my husband after I gave him a sample from a recent Sephora order. My husband has a rather decent and interesting fragrance collection and Acqua di Parma is one of his favorites for summer. It smells, great on him - masculine, citrusy, crisp, refreshing.		2011-07-20T12:58:25.000+00:00					45-54		P163604
39	18746208	P163604	3	Undecided	After ready all the reviews, I finally broke down and ordered this for my husband. We were both excited to smell it. At first it is very lemony, reminds me of lemon scented Pledge, then it smells like wood in a fire pit the night after-sort of smokey and woodsy. Got to say, it is just all right. But once it develops, it is interesting. I am not going to say that I absolutely love it, but it is intriguing. My husband seems to like it a bit more than I do. Maybe I should try it on...lol.		2011-06-16T14:26:20.000+00:00					35-44		P163604
40	18732773	P163604	3	Good scent for mature crowd	The scent is definitely timeless, but meant for an older crowd. The quality of this scent is one of the best in my small collection of fragrances.

47	16606458	P163604	5	Classic scent, uplifting	"I first found out about this line via hotel bath samples during a business trip many years ago, and I instantly fell in love with it. As soon as I got home, I tracked it down and it instantly became my signature scent for years.

It's light, clean, uplifting, and perfect for work / day. It lasts at least twice, possibly three times, as long as any of my other perfumes (Tokyo Milk, Hermes, etc.). It has delicate citrus overtones to it, which always remind me of warm sunshine, and helps give me a boost on gloomy days.

The price is high, but as the over used saying goes, 'you get what you pay for.' For me, the overall quality (as opposed to the scent) of Acqua di Parma is the standard by which I now assess all perfumes when I'm considering a purchase."		2011-01-02T00:57:12.000+00:00					35-44		P163604

49	15721603	P163604	4	Not just for men	I love this scent. It smells great on my husband, but it actually also smells really good on me. The scent is citrusy at first, but mellows to something a bit more complex, a bit musky and heady. Women's perfumes always disappear on my skin after about an hour, but this stays and stays.		2010-10-02T11:36:01.000+00:00					25-34		P163604

51	14624496	P163604	1	Not light and citrusy	This is another from the acqua di parma line that claims to be citrusy and summery, but only wreaks of old lady. I enjoy and wanted other light summery scents but this one is something of old lady. A very odd scent but one I did not enjoy at all.		2010-07-08T12:38:40.000+00:00					25-34		P163604
52	14433387	P163604	5	sexy colonial	This fragrant first has a spicy, incense-like aroma for about 10 minutes then it dries down to a light amazing fresh french soap kinda scent that lasts for a good 6-8 hours. I caught myself sniffing at the sprayed spot every so often just so to be mentally transported back to my short honeymoon trip in Paris... Classic! Beautiful perfume!		2010-06-10T00:03:12.000+00:00					25-34		P163604

55	13862028	P163604	5	Fresh and smooth.	Truly a refreshing scent. Goes on smoothly without any irritation. Having tried a multitude of disappointing deodorants whose initial scent/character changed by evening, it was a pleasant surprise to find one which maintained it citrus/blossom smell. So good I could (almost) eat it !!!! Buy this deodorant without regret.		2010-04-01T18:30:34.000+00:00					35-44		P163604
56	13857754	P163604	5	AFTER SHAVE SMELLS GREAT ON MY HUSBAND	My husband was gifted with the after shave, and it spells so fresh and clean. It's citrusy and there's lavender (which I love with citrus) and spices, and it smells really good. He's gotten compliments while wearing it. Although his is after shave, I think it might also be a fragrance women would like to wear (but not the after shave) because a lot of women really seem to like it, judging by their comments.		2010-04-01T01:30:39.000+00:00					45-54		P163604

58	13274834	P163604	5	Serious sophistication.	"I've had this cologne for quite some time,but just gotten around to reviewing it. This is my favorite grownup scent.I purchased it at Disney's Epcot center,in the Italian pavillion.I liked it right away,and when the beautiful Italian saleswoman told me that it was a signature scent of Audrey Hepburn,I was sold. (Guess you had to be there).
It's a beautiful cologne,but for some reason,I only wear it in winter. It's heady and very easily overdone.However,it's fabulous if you remember to spray,stay,and walk away. One bottle will last me a very long time."		2010-01-18T21:21:05.000+00:00					over 54		P163604
59	12935726	P163604	2	Okay but not for me...	I received a decant of this fragrance and read numerous glowing reviews of this classic scent. However, after trying it for myself, I have to say that it is not something I would wear. I could possibly see this work on others. I would describe it as a mature fragrance with the lavender being the most distinguished note that carries throughout the fragrance as well as a strong cedarwood flow. It conjures up, for me, handmade lavender soap given to me as a gift and an image of a one room school house from the 1880's (yeah I know, don't get ME to write a perfume description, lol)		2009-11-29T09:22:02.000+00:00					18-24		P163604
60	12231032	P163604	5	Classic, elegant, sophisticated sexy	My boyfriend wears this scent and I was addicted from the moment I smelled it on him.

66	11573131	P163604	5	Love It	"This scent has become a holy grail for me - it's lemony and crisp and a perfect pick me up. Lots of throw and wearability, dries down nicely and stays on for quite sometime. A lovely splurge and, for me, a signature scent.

It's a little masculine, but until I can find a man who smells like Colonia I'll be happy sniffing myself all day."		2009-06-16T17:18:45.000+00:00					25-34		P163604

72	9346171	P163604	2	Acqua Di Parma Shampoo	It's just okay - I bought it to enjoy the fragrance but there is very little scent during shampooing and no scent left on the hair after. It also leaves my natural untreated blonde hair dry, so if you color your hair it might make it even drier. Definitely need a conditioner after using it.		2008-10-23T18:47:56.000+00:00							P163604

To those of you who complain about the fragrance not lasting long enough... this is a true natural fragrance and the methods use to make them haven’t changed since creation. Today’s fragrances have lots of additional chemicals to make the fragrance last longer. Acqua Di Parma is a true luxury fragrance.	True	2021-03-15T03:01:08.000+00:00							P375388

6	138980171	P375388	5		I’ve received a sample as a gift, but really fell in love with it and considering getting a full size version. It’s very refreshing, very light but also distinctive. For something that is so light and summery, it actually offers a lot of complexity. Beautiful watery fig and zesty citrusy notes - it’s anything but boring. It lasts on my skin about half a day, and way longer if I spray it on my hair. I feel like on a hot day it lasts longer and opens up more citrusy, too.

It is unisex and I have been complimented by men how good it smells. It however only lasts for 2-3hours and that is why I am giving it 4 stars. Otherwise, it is one of my favorite scent during the spring to late summer.	True	2018-07-15T18:04:53.000+00:00	Combination	Brown	Black	Fair			P375388
