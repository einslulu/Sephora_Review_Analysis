Anyways...I've been using this for almost a month and I have definitely noticed a different in the overall hydration of my skin. I have combo skin and with that, quite a few areas of my face that are really dry. Since I've been using this, that's gone. My entire face is hydrated and dewy. It'sn lightweight and gentle but super effective. With that being said, the price point is the part I'm not loving. For me to give 5 stars and actually buy it for the price it actually is, well, it would have to do everything from hydrate, fight aging as well as my breakouts, and have spf in it. I really do like it, and by that I mean I like it enough that if it was more reasonably priced, I would def buy it again.
