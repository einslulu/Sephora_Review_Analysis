Since COVID-19 hit the world, the past year has changed consumers’ everyday routine and home experiences that ultimately impacted the way consumers interact with the beauty industry. According to COVID-19 Trends tracked by Spate NYC, Americans have been adapting to the new lifestyle as well as shifting their consumer behavior and demand. Some shifts are temporary, but some come with a lasting impact on consumers’ daily routine and mentality, which will change the way they engaged with different beauty categories. While it still takes time to go back to normal in the US, Spate mentioned that consumers are adapted to new routines at home, indicating shifts among the main categories that could bring happiness at home during the epidemic.

Sephora, the leader in prestige beauty Omni-retail with a roughly 80% of US market share, operates 2,021 stores in 35 countries worldwide, with an expanding base of over 500 stores across the Americas. Owned by LVMH, the world’s leading luxury goods group, Sephora US reached approximately 1.3 billion dollars of sales volume in 2020. According to the latest financial report, Sephora occupies 97% (2021 out of 2072) stores under the segment of selective retailing and expanded 64 branches globally in 2020. However, because the traffic in stores can easily create a health crisis, Sephora closed more than 90% of stores worldwide for almost two months and responded to the unprecedented success of online sales. Even though stores were gradually reopened from May to the end of June with special attention, the whole segment of selective retailing still went down more than 30%. This demonstrated the resilience of omnichannel strategy during the global health crisis and the substantial negative impact of the epidemic on the beauty industry.

Our proposed project is motivated by our interest in the beauty industry to identify the category and product level trends that have gained traction both post-pandemic and during the pandemic. The main category level contains Fragrance, Skincare, Makeup, Hair, Value & Gifts sets, Tools & Brushes, Bath & Body, Men, Wellness and Nail. To select the top 3 products on the selected main categories, we developed a model using seven indicators to measure what kind of products can bring customers joy during the COVID-19. In this project, we want to answer the following questions on three levels: general level, category level, and specific product level.



1. General: Is there any correlation among price, love, product life, number of reviews, and rating? What are the correlations among price, love, product life, number of reviews, and rating for each main category
2. Category level: Which main category was heavily impacted by the epidemic? Which main category has experienced the highest review changes during the epidemic? 
3. Product level: What kind of indicators can measure products that bring customers happiness during COVID-19? What kind of products in the top selected categories bring customers happiness during COVID-19?
